# Building

I decided to do a thing. This thing would include no JavaScript pre-processor, it's an example of React, without JSX. Because JavaScript _with_ JSX and webpack and babel can be scary.

## Architecture

- github pages
- github api
- materialize
  - css library feels better than react library
  - also easier than react library when no babel+webpack
